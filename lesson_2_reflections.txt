What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden folder is created to contain the history of files and all the repository information
I need it so git realizes a repository is in this location.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Well a working directory is related to the Operating system not directly to git
Staging area allows us to control what should be commited is an intermediate step
between the working directory and the repository.

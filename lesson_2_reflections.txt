What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden folder is created to contain the history of files and all the repository information
I need it so git realizes a repository is in this location.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Well a working directory is related to the Operating system not directly to git
Staging area allows us to control what should be commited is an intermediate step
between the working directory and the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You may also want to commit your changes to the file

In spite of the fact that you have modified several files you can add to the staging area
just the ones you need to commit, that is, just the logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you have some sort of standard message per task o per new funcionality then an entire branch could have the same 
initials and when your merged into the branch master and make a git log command then all history should be 
kind of organized.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Visual help is always more easy to understand than words
we can see exacly what we wanted

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Two branches, that is, two paths, are joined.
